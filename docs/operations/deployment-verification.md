# Deployment verification

Before release, run the [development checks](../development/testing.md) against a disposable environment and confirm [migration prerequisites](../setup/migrations.md). Review deployment logs and environment configuration.

After release, inspect home/blog navigation, article pages, taxonomy, public authors and sitemap. Confirm former published URLs redirect directly with 308, while unpublished/deleted destinations return 404. Check auth and recovery redirects/templates, API authorization and publication errors without creating production test content. Inspect newsletter cron logs and queue status; authenticated dispatcher calls may send real emails.

Keep AI output in drafts until a human editor reviews accuracy, attribution, taxonomy and SEO. See [content cleanup and dated audit](content-cleanup.md) and [publication rules](../features/publication-and-slugs.md). Production cleanup and publication require deliberate editorial decisions.
